# MSC Computing - Practicum Project

The use of open-source software in large projects has been growing in the last number of years. Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in open-source software and this measuring the risk of using these projects is essential. This project is an analysis on the risk of using open-source software. It aims to combine the commonly used methods of predicting risk to give a more rounded analysis of the risk.

## Code 

The analysis was split up into the three different objects of analysis that are commonly used to examine risk in open-source projects. The aim we have is to combine these to give a more comprehensive view of the risk in using a particular open-source project.

### Risk Prediction Using Software Metrics

The first part of the analysis was done using features of the code itself to predict whether the file is vulnerable or not.

### Risk Prediction Using Project Activity

This part of the analysis aims to predict how well the project is maintained and thus how quick the response time will be to any issues or vulnerabilities reported by users or developers.

### Risk Prediction Using Vulnerability Database Data

This part of the analysis aims to predict how many vulnerabilities will be reported monthly for the project. This will give an indicator as to how risk-prone the project is.
