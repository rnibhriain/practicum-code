# MSC Computing - Practicum Project 

This repository contains all of the research that I did for my practicum project during my time at Dublin City University. The use of open-source software in large projects has been increasing in the last number of years. Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in open-source software and thus measuring the risk of using these projects is essential. In large projects, there can be a number of dependencies which depend on other projects which leads to developers being unaware of the risks that they are exposing themselves to - such as unmaintained projects. This project is a tool for the analysis of the risk of using open-source software. The tool aims to investigate the dependency tree of a project and analyse the risk for each of the sub-dependencies giving the user a visual way to explore the risk level of their dependencies.

## Security Analysis Code - Analysis.py üíª

The aim of the analysis is to analyse and pinpoint the dependencies that are exposing a project to risk. We extract the dependencies from a dependency tree provided by a Maven project. The analysis was split up into two different objects of analysis that are commonly used to examine risk prediction in open-source projects. Both project activity and the number of vulnerabilities per month are indicators of how risky a project is according to the literature we reviewed. The aim we have is to combine these to give a comprehensive view of the risk in using a particular open-source project. A dependency with some vulnerabilities may be less risky if it is well maintained and a dependency that is not maintained may be less risky if there are never any vulnerabilities associated with it. 

### Setup

The setup involves populating the dependency links using the input in the mapping file provided. This is used to analyse the GitHub repo information - for either counting commits or counting the number of days to resolve issues. The second piece of setup involves taking the configuration file as provided/edited by the user and placing it into the configuration object.

### Finding and Graphing the Dependencies (of a Maven Project)

The first part of the analysis involves finding the dependencies of a project using the output from the maven dependency tree. We assign each dependency a node in the graph and add edges according to its depth in the dependency tree. The node is coloured based on its analysed and predicted risk (according to the levels set by the user). 

### Risk Prediction Using Project Activity

This part of the analysis aims to predict how well the project is maintained and thus how quick the response time will be to any issues or vulnerabilities reported by users or developers. We measure both the time-to-fix issues and the number of commits per month. The user has the option of exploring risk through commits/issues or both. We return the predicted value for the next month. 

### Risk Prediction Using Vulnerability Database Data

This part of the analysis aims to predict how many vulnerabilities will be reported monthly for the project. This will give an indicator as to how risk-prone the project is. We extract keywords from dependencies and use these to find associated CVEs using the NVD API. We then count the monthly vulnerabilities and aim to predict these. We return the predicted value for the next month.

## Data üìë

- dependencies1-5.txt - test dependency trees files
- config.JSON - configuration file
- github_urls.txt - mapping file for libraries in the dependency trees and their corresponding GitHub URLs
- requirements.txt - requirements that need to be installed to run this project

## Project Instructions‚ùó

The idea is that this project and its corresponding data - config.JSON, github_urls.txt can be placed in a folder with a Maven project. The user can enable the configuration options as they see fit - to analyse issues/commits, the number of days/commits they see as appropriate and the number of vulnerabilities before they consider the dependency to be risky. Then the user can run the program which will gather the dependencies and analyse their GitHub activity and NVD vulnerabilities to see which of their dependencies are risky (in their decided levels). 

### Windows Instructions
